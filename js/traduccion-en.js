      Commercial and scientific satellites are equipped with greater on-board radio frequency (RF) power to respond to the increasing demand of data volumes, which necessitates more frequent transmissions at higher rates. This, however, increases the likelihood of RF voltage breakdown and unwanted interferences, reducing and even endangering payload performance. Therefore, high-power density in RF components requires careful design, analysis and ground testing.
    </p>
    <p>
      RF power on-board spacecraft has been increased significantly over the past few years and it is expected that this trend will continue for the next generation of satellites. Some telecommunication satellites are equipped with a large number of channels, combined into a single antenna feed (multicarrier operation). Remote sensing RF payloads require higher power transmission on single antenna array (single carrier operation). Additionally, navigation satellite fleets have also seen a progressive power enhancement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Multipactor and Corona effect are two discharge phenomena which may happen in RF components on-board spacecraft. Voltage breakdown occurs when the generation of electrons exceeds the removal of electrons from the component surface or the intermediary gas. In the event of RF voltage breakdown, the two main electron generation mechanisms are ionisation of the gas by electron collision (Corona), and secondary electron emission from the surfaces (Multipactor). This last phenomenon is very much related to the Secondary Emission Yield properties of the material (SEY).
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the physics involved in these two phenomena is different, separate approaches have been followed over the last few decades to eliminate, or at least reduce, the risk of discharge on board RF equipment and components. Despite the efforts, the threat of RF voltage breakdown is still a serious issue when designing and manufacturing RF components for space applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      Passive Intermodulation (PIM) is a kind of interference generated on passive components where two or more signals travel towards the transmitting antenna. This unwanted interference creates intermodulation products which might fall within the receive frequency band with the corresponding “jamming” effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Power Handling testing involves subjecting the device to a maximum continuous RF power (CW) regime under vacuum and extreme temperature conditions, in order to verifying the device under test’s capabilities to deal with the large amounts of heat that the Joule effect produces in a harsh environments .

  textoMultipactor:`
    Multipactor is a weak discharge phenomenon threating radio-frequency circuits on-board the spacecraft. Multipactor occurs under high vacuum conditions when the field and impact accelerate free electrons, captured by the associated RF electric field, on the circuit structure with sufficient energy to liberate secondary electrons. As the field changes polarity, these electrons accelerate, impact on the opposite surface and again liberate secondary electrons. As the process is repeated millions of times per second, an avalanche of electrons rapidly grows, initiating a multipactor discharge. The immediate consequence of this process is in the shape of degradation of the RF signal; however, it can lead to surface erosion and eventually, the breakdown of the transmission path.
  `,
  textoCorona:`
    Ionisation breakdown (Corona) occurs at higher pressures than those for multipactor. During a Corona discharge, electrons are produced through collisions between electrons and gas molecules. This type of discharge is dependent not only on pressure but also on the type of gas. The phenomenon starts when a concentration of free electrons is generated through resonant collisions between electrons and gas molecules. The electrons accumulate in a charge cloud that is swept between or along the conductor surfaces. With each pass of the electric field, the electrons interact with the molecules causing additional charge accumulation and thermal dissipation. This process will continue until the energy density is sufficient to form a plasma arc between conductors. As a result, the damage caused in the RF path is quite severe.

  textoPim:`
    Passive Intermodulation (PIM) is a kind of interference generated on passive components where two or more signals travel towards the transmitting antenna. This unwanted interference creates intermodulation products which might fall within the receive frequency band with the corresponding “jamming” effect. When high power transmit signals are in close proximity to low power receive signals, then passive intermodulation products (PIM) generated by the high power transmit signals can interfere directly with the low power receive signals and results in channel distortion, degradation and data corruption. This unwanted intermodulation interference is being attributed to metal-to-metal junctions in waveguide sections, connectors, thermal blankets, ground wires, attachments, rivets, etc…

  textoPowerHandling:`
    Power Handling testing involves subjecting the device to a maximum continuous RF power (CW) regime under vacuum and extreme temperature conditions. The goal is to ensure that the device is capable of operating properly throughout its operational life. Operating at maximum power generates a greater amount of heat due to the Joule effect. The increased temperature produces changes in some properties of the transmission medium, such as conductivity, geometry, and even the state of matter. A Power Handling test is closely related to verifying the device's ability to transfer heat in an environment as complex as space.
  `,
  textoAmplificadores:`
    Amplifiers used in radiofrequency testing for PIM, multipactor, corona, and power handling must deliver high power, linearity, and stability under extreme conditions. These devices enable RF components to be subjected to elevated signal levels to assess their behavior under nonlinear phenomena and electrical discharges. In vacuum environments or specialized chambers, amplifiers ensure precise and continuous excitation, which is essential for detecting failures, validating designs, and meeting aerospace standards. Their robustness and ability to operate in specific bands make them key tools for characterizing materials, connectors, and transmission systems in critical high-frequency applications.
  `,
  textoCamaras:`
    Vacuum and PIM (Passive Intermodulation) chambers are essential for advanced radiofrequency testing in controlled environments. These facilities enable the evaluation of critical phenomena such as multipactor effects, corona discharge, power handling, and passive intermodulation, which can compromise the performance of space and telecommunications systems. By simulating extreme vacuum and high-power conditions, they ensure the reliability of RF components in satellites, radars, and base stations. These tests are key to validating designs, preventing failures, and complying with stringent aerospace and communications standards, ensuring electromagnetic integrity in high-demand applications.
